Project Documentatioellyfish Typesn: J  Classification 
Using Ai


Project Overview

This project, Jellyfish Types Classification Using AI*, is designed to accurately identify and classify different jellyfish species using artificial intelligence. By analyzing jellyfish images based on shape, color, and other features, this system provides a robust classification tool that can be used for various applications, including scientific research, conservation, and safety in aquatic environments.

The project is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), particularly the *VGG16 architecture, to classify jellyfish images. The final model is deployed using **Flask*, which provides a web interface where users can upload images and receive classification results.

 5. Detailed Implementation Steps

 Step 1: Data Collection
   - Collect a dataset of jellyfish images, labeled by species to ensure accurate classification.

 Step 2: Organize Dataset
   - Create a structured directory with separate *Train* and *Test* folders for model training and testing.

 Step 3: Data Preprocessing
   - *ImageDataGenerator*: Use Keras’s ImageDataGenerator to augment and preprocess data.
   - *Image Augmentation*: Apply transformations such as rotation, rescaling, and flipping to improve model generalization.

 Step 4: Model Building

1. *Import Libraries*: Import essential Keras libraries, including VGG16 for the CNN model.
2. *Load VGG16*: Initialize the VGG16 model without the top (output) layers to modify the architecture for jellyfish classification.
3. *Add Fully Connected Layers*:
   - Use additional Dense layers to fine-tune the model for this specific classification task.
4. *Compile the Model*:
   - Define the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics to train the model.
5. *Train the Model*:
   - Train the model on the training data and validate it on the test set to track accuracy.
6. *Save the Model*:
   - Save the trained model as cnn.h5 to use in the Flask application.

 Step 5: Flask Application Development

1. HTML Templates*:
   - index.html: The main page for image upload.
   - predict.html: Displays the uploaded image and a button to classify it.
   - output.html: Shows the classification result.

2. *Build Flask App*:
   - *app.py*: The main Flask script to handle requests, load the trained model, and perform image classification.
   - Define application routes:
     - /: Renders the index.html page for image upload.
     - /predict: Processes the uploaded image and displays the classification result on output.html.
