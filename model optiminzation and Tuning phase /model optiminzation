1. Hyperparameter Tuning
    Learning Rate Adjustment: Experiment with different learning rates to find the one that achieves the best balance between convergence speed and model accuracy.
    Batch Size Tuning: Test various batch sizes to optimize training speed and memory usage.
    Optimizer Selection: Compare optimizers like Adam, SGD, RMSprop, etc., and document their impact on performance.
    Epochs: Experiment with different numbers of epochs to determine the point of diminishing returns.
Implementation:
              Code or scripts where hyperparameters are adjusted systematically.
              Logs or notebooks showing how hyperparameters impact training/validation accuracy.
2. Model Architecture Optimization
              Experiment with changes in the model architecture:
              Add or remove layers.
              Change activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, etc.).
              Use different pooling strategies (e.g., max pooling, average pooling).
              Evaluate and compare lightweight models for faster inference.
              Implementation:
              Updated or alternate model scripts.
              Performance comparisons of various architectures.
3. Regularization Techniques
      Dropout Layers: Introduce dropout to prevent overfitting.
      Weight Decay: Use L1/L2 regularization to constrain the model's complexity.
Implementation:
            Provide examples of regularization code.
            Visualize the reduction in overfitting using loss curves for training and validation.
4. Data Augmentation
      Enhance the dataset by applying augmentation techniques:
      Flipping, rotation, zooming, shearing, or adding noise to images.
      Augmentation can improve the model's ability to generalize.
      Fine-tune the model with the augmented dataset and evaluate its impact.
Implementation:
            Augmented dataset generation scripts.
            Performance logs before and after data augmentation.
5. Transfer Learning
      Fine-tune a pre-trained model like ResNet, VGG, or Inception for jellyfish classification.
      Document how transfer learning impacts accuracy and reduces training time.
      Implementation:
      Include the transfer learning script (e.g., using keras.applications or PyTorch models).
      Record and compare metrics before and after fine-tuning.
6. Performance Metrics Analysis
      Evaluate and optimize the model using:
      Accuracy: Overall classification accuracy.
      Precision, Recall, F1-score: Particularly useful if the dataset is imbalanced.
      Confusion Matrix: To analyze class-specific performance.
      Use visualization tools like TensorBoard or Matplotlib for clarity.
      Implementation:
      Scripts for generating confusion matrices or precision-recall curves.
      Metric comparisons during optimization.
7. Quantization and Pruning
      Optimize the model for deployment:
      Quantization: Reduce the model size by converting weights to lower precision (e.g., from float32 to int8).
      Pruning: Remove redundant connections or neurons to reduce computational cost.
      Implementation:
      Quantized/pruned model files.
      Documented changes in model size and performance.
8. Evaluation of Computational Resources
      Test the optimized model on different hardware (e.g., GPUs, CPUs).
      Measure inference time and memory usage to ensure deployment feasibility.
      Implementation:
      Logs of resource utilization before and after optimization.
      Scripts for benchmarking inference speed.
      Deliverables for the Folder
      Scripts and notebooks for:
      Hyperparameter tuning.
      Architecture optimization.
      Regularization and data augmentation.
