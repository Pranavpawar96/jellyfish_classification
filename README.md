Jellyfish Types Classification Using AI
Overview
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques to accurately identify and classify different types of jellyfish. By analyzing jellyfish images based on their morphology, coloration, and other distinguishing features, the project aims to create a robust classification system for scientific research, conservation efforts, and marine ecosystem management.

Scenarios of Use
Marine Biology Research
Marine biologists can use this classification system to study species distribution, behavior patterns, and ecological interactions. This helps in understanding biodiversity and the effects of environmental factors on jellyfish populations.

Conservation and Environmental Monitoring
Environmental agencies can monitor jellyfish populations in oceans and coastal areas to assess marine health, track abundance, and implement conservation measures.

Project Objectives
Develop a robust AI model to classify jellyfish types using image data.
Provide insights into jellyfish species for research and conservation.
Create an application to make jellyfish classification accessible for users.
